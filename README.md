Sphuron is an online platform for finding your tutor on STEM subjects.

- Choose your desired subject
- Pick your tutor
- ‚ú®Learn and grow together ‚ú®      

## Demo
A video demo can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q71UoBh5sMf1lcr7WJ2DsyUjSZ4pTwPh/view).

## Tech

Sphuron uses a number of open source projects to work properly.

Backend:
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [oracledb] - A Node.js module for Oracle Database access

Frontend
- [HTML]
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery]
- [ejs]

## Installation

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/id/database/technologies/oracle-database-software-downloads.html#19c). Be sure to add `node` to your system path.

Create a new user for oracle. Open command prompt, and type the following:
```sh
sqlplus /nolog
connect / as sysdba
create user c##shuaib identified by [password]
```
In line 3, you don't have to put the `[]` in your command prompt when entering the password. You can opt for a different username like `c##anothername`, but the sql dump (located in `db_dump/C##SHUAIB.sql`) has been hard coded to `c##shuaib`. If you are using a different username, be sure to change all the `c##shuaib` from the sql dump to your provided username.

If you have git installed on your computer, clone this project from the terminal, or you can simply download it as `.zip`.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shuaibw/OTMS/
cd OTMS
```

Configure `.env` variables. If you are using `c##shuaib` as your username, just edit the password here you entered before.
```sh
SESSION_SECRET = "SUPERSECRETKEYNONEWOULDEVERGUESS"
DB_USER = "C##SHUAIB"
DB_PASSWORD = "hr"
DB_CONNSTR = "localhost/orcl"
```
Reconstruct database from `db_dump/C##SHUAIB.sql`. You can do this from any IDE of your choice. I used [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/en/). You might have to comment out the `DROP TABLE` statements from `C##SHUAIB.sql` for this to work without erros. If you are really having trouble then just skip this dump, and manually run each of the sql files from `sql_queries/` folder.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
Go to `localhost:3000/login`. Here you can either create a new account, or login with the following credentials:
```sh
As student
username: shuaib
password: shuaib

As instructor:
username: crick
password: crick
```
